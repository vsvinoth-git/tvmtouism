    <div class="sub"><p style="font-size: 20px;">With its history closely knitted to the famous Annamalaiyar Temple, Tiruvannamalai is a destination that is steeped in history
        and spirituality. The headquarters of a district in Tamil Nadu of the same name, the city spreads in the foothills of Annamalai Hills atop which 
        stands the divine Hindu pilgrimage destination, Arunachaleshwar Temple Kulam. Yes, the credit for major Tiruvannamalai tourism can be given to this
         religious place that is dedicated to Lord Shiva where he worshipped in the form of a Lingam. It is believed that Lord Shiva is present here as
          Agni (Fire) Lingam. Here, Goddess Parvati is worshipped in the form of Unnamulaiyamman. Spreading in 10 hectares of land, this top place to 
          visit in Tiruvannamalai has not only made its mark as one of the largest temples in India but it boasts housing the tallest Gopuram (Spire) in 
          the country at 66 m. It is indeed a good idea to visit Tiruvannamalai during the Brahmotsavam, which is basically the celebration of four prime 
          festivals between November and December each year. A large deepam (earthen lamp) containing three tons of Ghee (class of clarified butter) lit 
          in the celebration of Karthikai Deepam is the major attraction when visiting during the festival.</p></div></div>
        <div class="aruna"><p style="font-size: 20px;">Another must-see during the Karthikai Festival is the traditional Cattle Fair, which is a 4-day fair in which 20,000 animals are brought for trade.
             Apart from the temple, Tiruvannamalai has three Ashrams - Sri Seshadri Swamigal Ashram, Yogi Ram Surathkumar Ashram, and Sri Ramana Ashram. All
              three ashrams are special in their own way, however, the Yogi Ram Surathkumar Ashram is said to even offer an unparalleled visual treat. It is,
               in fact, is considered one of the most beautiful places in Tiruvannamalai. The existence of such spiritual destinations creates a beautiful
                aura of the city, somewhere you can visit to enjoy a very soulful holiday by seeking the blessing of the Almighty. Other than a pilgrimage, 
                one can relish a day nature outing to Sathanur dam, some 35 km from Tiruvannamalai. The dam is ideal to have that pleasant little picnic with 
                friends and family amidst scenic settings. There is also a crocodile farm and mini zoo to add to the fun. Tiruvannamalai also has two 
                attractions for its visitors situated at a short distance away - Padaveedu Village also known as the village of temples and Javadu Hills. 
                Tour My India has the best Tiruvannamalai travel guide that proffers detailed information on top attractions, activities, transportation, 
                weather and accommodation options.</p></div></div><br>

    <div class="dam1"><p style="font-size: 20px;">Sathanur Dam, a stunning engineering marvel, is located at a distance of 30 kilometres from the city of Thiruvannamalai in Tamil Nadu. 
        This breathtaking structure has been built over River Thenpennai (River Pennaiyar) flowing through the Chennakesava Hills in Thandarampet Taluk. 
        The reservoir is called the Sathanur Reservoir and is considered as one of the major dams in the state. The structure consists of pleasant parks, 
        a fish grotto and a huge crocodile farm that attracts nature enthusiasts and tourists from all over the world. The site is strikingly beautiful during
         the monsoons as the river gushes with clear waters. It is so attractive that it has been a favourite spot for many feature films, especially in the
          50s and 60s.The dam was built to benefit the agricultural produce in Thiruvannamalai and the adjoining regions of the city. The region is dotted with
           a children's park, a small zoo and a swimming pool. Photography is not allowed in the area.
        </p></div></div><br>

            and the Glass House.</p></div></div><br>
        <div class="hill4"><p style="font-size: 20px;">The Javadhu Hills are
             an extension of the Eastern Ghats spread across parts of Tirupattur and Tiruvannamalai districts in the northern part of the state of Tamil Nadu 
             in southeastern India. This range separates Tirupattur and Tiruvannamalai districts. Tirupattur district lies on the north-western side and 
             Tiruvannamalai district lies on the south-eastern side of this range. The towns of Tirupattur, Vaniyambadi and Ambur of Tirupattur district are 
             located on the north western side and the towns of Chengam and Polur of Tiruvannamalai district are located on the south eastern side. The hills 
             consist of bluish-gray granites, with peaks averaging 3,800â€“4,000 feet. About 50 miles wide and 20 miles long, they are bisected into eastern and
              western sections by the Cheyyar and Agaram rivers, tributaries of the Palar. "The Barahmahal hills to the west are somewhat bare, but the Jawadhi

    <div class="fort"><p style="font-size: 20px;">Known as the "Troy of the East" by the British, Gingee Fort is located in Villupuram District of Tamil Nadu, 160 kilometres from the state capital,
         Chennai and near the Union Territory of Puducherry. Locals have given the fort some notable names such as Senji, Chenji, Jinji or Senchi Fort.
          The majestic fort has three different hilltop citadels and a massive boundary of thick walls and cliffs. Owing to its enormous structure the 
          fort is fortified to the extent that Shivaji, the Maratha king, named it as the "most impregnable fortress in India." Visiting the fort makes 
          one learn the reason for why it has been called by such influential names. As you reach the fort, you realise that it has been located at the 
          most strategic location which made it difficult for the enemies to enter its premise. The fort indeed is a result of genius minds.</p></div></div>

          <div class="fort1"><p style="font-size: 20px;">Constructed mostly in the 16th century by the Vijayanagara Empire, the fort was later captured by the Marathas following the rule of Mughals, 
            French and British on it. The fort was then sadly abandoned in the 19th century. Today while few foreigners visit her, Gingee is heavily flocked by
             the domestic tourists for starring in various films. The main road between Puducherry and Tiruvannamalai segments through the fort, just to the
              west of Gingee town. Out of the three citadels situated atop, the most unchallenging to reach is Krishnagiri which rises on the north side of the 
              road. To the west is the highest of the three, Rajagiri, and the most distant and least compelling is Chakklidurg which lies in the south-east
               direction. The remnants of the Gingee fort and their dramatic beauty form a peaceful setting making it a very worthwhile spot. Hence, a day trip 
               to the fort is no harm. You surely are going to return with some fantastic pictures and a rich sense of history.</p>

  <div class="ashram"><p style="font-size: 20px;">Located at the foothills of the Arunachala hills, to the west of Thiruvannamalai in Tamil Nadu, the Ramana Ashrama is famous for having served as 
        home to the modern sage and Advaita Vedanta philosopher, Ramana Maharshi, from the year 1922, until his death in the year 1950. The Samadhi shrine
         of Maharshi Ramana continues to attract devotees from all over, who love to visit the place to relax and refresh themselves, far away from the 
         maddening crowd and hustle bustle of the city.
        The Sage Maharshi Ramana was regarded as an outstanding enlightened being by his followers. Many devotees got attracted to his charismatic 
            personality, and his teachings are now spread in many regions, making him respected and renowned all across the globe. This is perhaps why the 
            Ramana Ashram continues to be a favourite tourist attraction that is visited by thousands of devotees every year.</p></div></div>
            <div class="ashrama"><p style="font-size: 20px;">The ashram gradually grew in its present location only after the settlement of Ramana Maharshi near the Samadhi shrine of his mother
                 Alagammal, who died on May 19 in 1922. Initially, just a single small hut was built there. By 1924, two huts were set up, one of which
                  was opposite the samadhi and the other one was to the north. The Ramana Ashram is the perfect place to be at not just for those 
                  interested in Vedanta, but also for those who are curious about Indian spirituality and wish to learn more about it.</p></div>

                    The Matrubhuteswara Shrine was constructed under the supervision of Vaidyanatha Stapati, a famous architect. The sanctum sanctorum of the 
                    complex contains a sacred Siva Linga and a Sri Chakra Meru sanctified by Sri Maharshi's touch.
                    A magnificent shrine built out of superior granite can be found on the northern side. The pillars in this shrine contain several images of 
                    gods and goddesses. A small Nandi is also placed on a high pedestal and faces the entrance to the Garbha Griha. The Ashram also houses the
                     Maharshi's tomb, which comprises of a large mandap with a tower surmounting it, and a white marble lotus in the centre; the Old Hall and the

                    <div class="fort"><p style="font-size: 20px;">The Skandashram was established by Kandasawmi who took the initiative of getting constructed the primary part of the building 
                        that is now known as Skandashram. The Ashram is actually a cave that is very close to the Virupaksha Cave. The Ashram has a
                         perennial spring that gives out clean and safe water for drinking purposes. The ventral side of the cave has two rooms that have
                          been constructed in linearity. The terrace of the ashram offers a splendid view of nature at its best. The thick and green 
                          growth of foliage combined with the azure of the sky is indeed breathtaking.Visible on the skyline of the town are the majestic
                           gopurams of the Arunachaleswara as well as the Thiruvannamalai Temples. It is believed that Bhagavan stayed in this Ashram 
                           until the death of his mother, Alagammal in 1922. Legend also has it that Sri Ramanas mother attained Samadhi at this Ashram 
                           in 1922.

                                          <p style="font-size: 20px;">Ramana lived at Skandashram from 1915 to 1922. This is where his mother joined him, and started preparing meals at the ashram, rather than
                                             having prepared food carried up, as had been the case since the earliest years. After the mahasamadhi of Mother, and her subsequent interment at
                                              the base of the hill, Ramana then took residence at her samadhi, the location of the present day Ramanasramam.
                                            I show here photos from a recent walk up the hill to Skandashram. We started about 7:15 in the morning, before it was too hot. We left out the
